~01416d9621d1598e03,Nemanja R.,Expert photoshop retoucher and photographer,"I am a longtime photographer as well as a high end retoucher with over 10 years of experience using Photoshop. As a photographer what I really enjoy working on is portraits and as a retoucher I specialize in beauty/fashion/editorial/corporate shoots. I also love creative surrealism and am highly skilled in other areas such as composite, background removals, replacements and such.

Great work takes time, there is no shortcut that can replicate that same result no matter what someone says. A professional could see a poorly retouched image a mile away, as a client you want to be sure you get nothing but the best. I always keep up to date with the industry but also regularly challenge myself to try something new that could add on top of the skills I have acquired along the way. 

Maybe you have a business or a brand that requires a specific look/style or perhaps you want to look your best in that headshot because that is the photo you would want to use to represent yourself for a job application. But your hair is all over the place, the skin looks tired, the photographer couldn't care less about the cluttered background because you already paid him in advance! Thats where I jump in. They say a picture is worth a 1000 words, make sure you are not missing 999 of those.

~01bfa437aa9ae14b2c,Dee D.,Accountant,"If you haven’t yet tried outsourcing your financial records management needs, I invite you to give it serious consideration. No matter how big or small your budget is, an effective business owner must constantly find ways to save money. Outsourcing your business accounting-needs can save you a lot. This will afford you the opportunity to invest instead in areas of your business that can help you to actually grow your business such as creating a new website, doing a marketing campaign or perhaps hiring a sales professional. 

Financial record management is an obligation that unfortunately doesn’t actually produce revenue for a business—unless your organization happens to be in the business of providing accounting services, but then again, it too would need to spend on keeping it’s books in order.

  ecosystem.

- Write custom rules for alerting critical messages within five minutes or normal messages 
  within twelve hours from Elasticsearch.

~01e9fe765f63b52f8b,Minh Nguyen T.,Sales Copywriter: Sales Pages & Email Campaigns for High-Ticket Offers,"Ah, yeah, I just raised my price from $50/hour to $100/hour as I've just launched my course and made over $100000 in the first 10 days.

So you're looking for high-converting sales pages & email campaigns for your product or service?

After a few years of writing emails & sales pages for my clients, I decided to build my own email list on July 1st, 2021.

After 30 days, I had around 6000 people on my email list with $0 spent on advertising. 

Then, after sending a few emails (3-4 emails/week), I got over 2500 people on my waitlist for the upcoming course.

The Open rate & Click rate are out of my imagination - I've never seen something like that in this space before. 

Interesting, right? The reason is pretty simple. This is not a magic trick.

Unlike many other copywriters who only try to push your potential customers, I focused on building solid relationships with my audience. 

I have my own list. I understand how important it is to do so. And if we were to work together, that's what we would try to achieve: ""Build a better relationship with your audience"".

Before we talk about writing sales pages, let's check out some of my reviews. 

This is the one I received from an affiliate marketer after I helped her rewrite her entire Welcome email sequence and got a 54.5% & 694% increase of the Open rate and Click rate respectively:

""I am very happy with the way the work was handled. He is not doing the work just to do it, Minh took time to do a deep study on what I needed, what I had done so far, and see how he could help me to improve my open and click rate. The emails he wrote are very good, I highly recommend him."" - Flor

Besides, if you're not ok with someone who is willing to go the extra mile just to see their sales copy perform better, I'm afraid I have very bad news for you. 

Since I believe that's the only way for us to have a win-win relationship, you would see lots of reviews like this:

""Minh once again going above and beyond. Always on time and extremely professional. Always open to any feedback and understanding the requirement. Look forward to working on more projects together soon"".

So anyway. Here's what I can provide:

✔️ Email sequences, email campaigns, sales emails - I hope that many other copywriters will soon realize the sender's name is way more important than the title and the preview text.

✔️ Long-form sales copy - Top copywriters spend the most time on the thing that the rest of copywriters are not willing to do - ""Research"".

That's why when it comes to writing sales pages. Here are the 3 most important things to me:

1️⃣ Market Research: Most copywriters take this very lightly, and that's why their sales copy can never be compelling. 

In fact, this process should make up more than 50% of the time. Usually, when I write a sales page, I spend my first 2-5 days just doing research.

2️⃣ The Big Idea

It blew my mind when I knew there are tons of copywriters out there who don't really understand what the ""Big Idea"" is. And the fact is whenever I randomly click on some ads on Facebook to see how they go with their sales pages. Over 80% of what I found didn't have a Big Idea.

What a huge mistake!

3️⃣ Well, I just screwed it up! 

Minh T.

P.S. I have more than 1000 characters left.

The reason I left the 3rd reason blank is that it's really up to you. You understand your business and your customers more than I do (this is obvious).

It's essential to jump on a call together so I can ask you questions I have in my questionnaire, so I can help you get the most out of your email campaigns and sales pages.

After all, if you don't agree with my approach, I'm afraid that we're not a good fit. But if you now feel very excited, yep, you just found something!

During my time in practise, I spent hundreds of hours drafting and proofreading legal documents including contracts, statutory declarations, affidavits, property deeds and more. My role was also exceptionally client focused and I spent vast amounts of time writing letters of advice. These required me to condense complex legal arguments into understandable content for lay clients. 

I was also fortunate enough to have an article published in the Law Society Gazette following on from a discussion I shared with one of the Gazette's writers. My article focused on my own path into the legal profession and also on reforms in leasehold property law. 

Prior to my legal career, I honed my writing and proofreading skills in a more academic context during my time studying for my Bachelor of Laws, Law School Diploma and Master of Laws. As one might imagine, during the 7 years I spent in academia, I was a prolific writer of essays and theses. This culminated in a 15,000 word dissertation concerning contract formation. 

I have excellent time management and client care skills, a formidable command of the English language and extensive knowledge of the laws of England and Wales, as well as a more rudimentary understanding of many areas of international law, the laws of other commonwealth countries and some knowledge of US law.

I also have passionate interests in literature, poetry, history and medicine, all of which I explore in my free time.

~010d4efa797f27c912,Long L.,Professional En-Vi-En translator and Vietnamese proofreading,"Hi there,

Let me tell you something.

Vietnamese is such a beautiful and complicated language, it can describe some meanings with just one word and it's tone. 
For example: the word ""dep"" will be ""beautiful"" when it was in ""đẹp"", it will be a shoe when it was in ""dép"" and it's meaning is ""stop"" if it was in ""dẹp"".

As you may see, to translate a English to Vietnamese is not hard. The important part is to make the reader feel like ""Ah, this is my language, I love to read it"". To do that, my process is as below:

Depend on what type of translation (website, audio, document, etc.), each one have it's own method. In general, it will look like:
          1. Collect the required information from customer.
          2. Reflect the collected information into excel file (to easy follow and manage).
          3. Translate line by line in excel file.
          4. Check vocabulary.
          5. Check grammar.
          6. Review 
The time to review take almost 50% of whole process. But for quality, I need to do that. It will be a foundation to get your smile :)


Working History In Upwork:
- Translate 250 words letter from English to Vietnamese. (5*)
- Translate 9 pages of English to Vietnamese (Customer 's requirement is 1 page). (5*)
- Translate a website of crowdfunding (On going).
- Transcript and translate a VR application (On going).
- Translate a short document in dating website. (5*)

Below is my information only, read it if you need.

I am Long Le (24), which was growing up in Vietnam since I were born and I am a native speaker. Currently, I do a full time job for the Japanese company in semiconductor industry. Where ACCURACY and PUNCTUALITY are the primary keys for success.

I got the TOEIC certificate of 800. This allows me to easily understand and communicate with the foreign customer, also I am able to understand almost all the normal English documents.

-------Work and Study Background
2013 - 2018 : I got the degree of bachelor of automation engineering of Ton Duc Thang University in HCMC, Vietnam. My final score in University is 7.05/10. 

2017 - now: I got a full-time job as Hardware engineer in Japanese company.

2015 - now: I have worked for a Class of Charity. I used to teach math and science for primary pupil.  My main job at this class:
• I search for poor children that are not allowed to go to school (lack of paper, not enough money) and bring them to the class. This info may make you confused, but in Vietnam, there are a lot of cases like I mentioned above. You can search ""Lớp Học Tình Thương Bà Mười"" on Facebook for more information.

Let's start with travel; who isn't passionate about travel? I have visited a number of different countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East, both for work and for pleasure. When visiting on holiday I like to try and avoid the typical 'tourist' sights and and focus more on the opportunity to experience the 'real' culture. I was based in Malaysia for just under two years, I then moved to Bangkok, Thailand, and I am now in Hoi An, Vietnam. 

My job: I am a Senior Regional Sales Manager for the schools and colleges division of a UK education company; recruiting students from across South East Asia, South Asia and ANZ to study in the UK. My previous roles were very similar; when I was in Thailand I was in an office-based role, facilitating student applications to the UK and working closely with university partners; when based in Malaysia I worked as the Country Development Manager, where I was required to travel across South East Asia to recruit students to a UK based university. During my time in the UK I covered South East Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East, again promoting the university to overseas students. I am passionate about my role within education and thrive from giving advice to students about study pathways, which is reflected in my education writing. I like to write about current education topics, as well as more generic help and advice pieces. 

Finally, events. I studied a Masters degree in International Events Management and I love attending events, organising events, reading about events, writing about events... Basically, everything about events! My passion for this industry is wide-scale and I enjoy writing about anything from local community events, to larger mega-events. I especially enjoy incorporating my love of fitness and sports into my events writing. I am an ultra runner and enjoy writing commentary about races that I have taken part in. I own a small vegan cafe and fitness centre in Hoi An, where I regularly hold fitness, and other related events.

I am an experienced content writer, editor and translator with 6+ years working for IDP Connect Limited (Education), Prehype (Entrepreneurship), Hollins University (Tutoring).

--
To whom it may concern,

I am applying with enthusiasm for the position at your company. With a wide range of experience in different fields such as data analysis, business development, marketing – communications, writing, and translation, etc. I am confident that I am a good fit for your organization. 

As a major in Economics and Data Analytics, I am interested in working with companies and supporting them in building their products and data-driven decision-making. During three months at Skipli, a tech start-up based in the U.S, I managed the Google Business Analytics of more than 80 restaurants, made use of my SEO skills to boost their products, analyzed the market, and increased the traffic rate by 200%/restaurant. 

As a student of the NASA L’SPACE Program, I also had the chance to work on financial risk analysis of projects. I learned to collaborate with other students to design a NASA mission project. This has become a concrete foundation for me to work as an intern at Prehype where I supported Entrepreneurs-in-Residence with their start-ups and new projects. I prepared several playbooks which explicitly explained the concepts, tips, and tricks commonly used by entrepreneurs during the early stages of their company.

Besides research and analysis skills, I also have experience working as Content Editor, Content Writer, Designer, and Marketing-Communication Intern in NGO, NPO, and multinational organizations such as IDP Connect Limited and ASEAN Foundation (AF). As a Communications intern at AF, I successfully spread the mission of AF to a larger community including Vietnamese youth via interactive social media posts, MC-ing at youth-driven ceremonies and competitions. I also designed posters and graphics in Canva to promote the organization’s messages to a wider audience. 

As a content editor at IDP Education, I am responsible for every article posted on our website. I come up with new content ideas to attract new visitors to our website. I am writing, editing, and proofreading articles, designing graphics for every post. I have helped increase the traffic by more than 50% in only 2 months. Sometimes, I help translate documents from English to Vietnamese and vice versa. My area of expertise includes content about education, business, finance, data analysis, freelance, etc.

Besides, I am familiar with reaching out to different companies while serving as the outreach director of the two most popular summer camps for Vietnamese high school students i.e. Harvard-Vietnam Summer Program (HVIET) and Think On. My main duty was searching for and maintaining close contacts with Vietnam-based companies and organizations such as Unilever, FPT, Tiki, the World Bank, BlueC, Bond, MiBrand, Hottab, etc. This part-time job has taught me invaluable lessons on how to make the best use of my communication skills to work and maintain close relationships with companies from different industries. 

In closing, I am drawn to this position because it is a new horizon to me. I would bring my experience in working with different multinational companies and assisting your organization in their decision-making process. Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this position further at your convenience.

~01821f2d3f70f9f341,Ngoc N.,Customer Service,"Dear Hiring Manager,
I am writing to express my interest in the vacancy posted on recruitment page.  Below is something about myself and my experience for your consideration: 

Target
-	To be an expert in Marketing industry including digital marketing, event, pr, communication, etc.
-	To learn and comprehend the managerial style between different cultures. 

Something about me – Briefly, I am ESTP person, which stand for
Extrovert: Actually, I am in the middle of Introvert and Extrovert scale. At the Extrovert side, I am always full of energy, self-motivated, creative and especially, love to make friends. I prefer to be a part of team than working alone, because I believe that every person definitely has at least one thing worth to learn, either knowledge or experience. On the other hand, introversion calms me down at work, it reminds me think carefully before doing something.
Sensing &Thinking: Due to the nature of work, I place great attention to details and the practical situation; seek rational and critical thinking before jump to conclusion and make decision. 
Perceiving: Perceiver is not an aimless drifter or spontaneous person. I am just flexible, adaptable and keep option open rather than box myself. For me, challenges are the best way to grow up, so that I do not hesitate to take new responsibility or something new. 

My strengths  
-	Customer handling
-	Customer relationship maintenance  
-	Planning and organizing skill
-	Data analyst and report performance 
-	Personal assistant for expat manager
-	Purchasing merchandise skill
-	Business risk control and management 

Two reasons I should be selected 
	Resilience: Banking is a high-risk industry. Therefore, there exist lots of pressures and challenges internally and externally. I have experienced at both back office and front line position. I fail, I was unsuccessful but I never give up, I always find reason to keep forward and do better.  
	Eager to learn: Skills can be trained; knowledge can be learnt. If a person is not willing to learn, they cannot thrive. I am eager to learn and accept challenges as the best lessons. In addition, I am proactive and diligent enough to finish job productively and effectively. Lastly, I prefer to learn from practical cases and from people because “Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don’t” I believe.
I hope to be a member of your professional team and eager to learn more experience from your organization.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this employment opportunity. 

Sincerely,
Ngoc Nguyen","Presentation Design, Customer Service, Data Collection, Market Research, Translation, Google Analytics, English to Vietnamese Translation, Digital Marketing",Vietnam,Ho Chi Minh,Ho Chi Minh City,15,USD,0,0,0,0

About Japanese, i have just learned about 1 year at my university. My faculty has many exchange programs which help student apply their language in daily life.  Because of this, my Japanese is enhanced so well. Now i can listen and speak quite good.

-----------------------------------------------
Hello there good-looking client; you can call me Olera. 

I'm a Digital Nomad who's now living in Vietnam because of their guerilla approach in life. Well, if you want to learn sales, you gotta learn it from the ""masters"", right? And well, well, well. I was correct. They're pretty much hardcore when it comes to selling things. 

You see, in Vietnam, it's a very different world. Almost every home has a business. If one opens a coffee shop, almost every one of their neighbors does it too. The government has allowed each home to use it's lowest floor to create any business they want... untaxable. 

The result? People here are business-minded. They love selling. You'll see they sell all kinds of stuff online. They don't have limiting beliefs about reaching out to people and selling what they want.  And I was lucky to be able to adopt their way of thinking. 

Not all are as lucky as me though. Some people say I have an unparalled talent in adopting and evolving. And I used the time I had this pandemic to evolve to where I am now.

You can say, I have a Vietnamese mindset when it comes to selling, to follow-ups, to reaching out and having no qualms in creating conversations that build a business --- with a Filipino heart (a heart that never gives up no matter what it takes).

I'm a Vietnamese soldier with a guerilla approach in life. I don't take no for an answer. 

If something doesn't work, it's not their fault. It's my fault. I own my failures, correct them, test again, and then celebrate my successes. 

That's how I was able to build a Facebook group of 100 people in less than 27 hours. 

Organically. 

Because I can. 

By the way, you can also call me Lorraine, if you're feeling fancy.

Growth makes my blood run like the Atlantic Ocean ready to eat a naïve ship alive if they don't know what they're doing. With kindness.

And let's be honest. There's a lot out there who don't know what they're doing. Your money getting siphoned so quickly you don't even know what happened. : ( 

That has happened a lot to business-owners who trusted their hard-earned money (or backer's money) to someone that's all talk and no strategy.

And we both know, we both wish...
Let not that be you.

Because, you might agree with me. The digital world is like the Atlantic Ocean. 

It's ruthless, merciless, and cold-blooded.

It's the new wild, wild world.

But

If we know how to sail your boat into the wild beast of an ocean, you'll end up at the sunnier side of the it with a pat on your back, enjoying a bottle of whiskey or a cup of coffee, knowing that you conquered the abyss that doesn't happen to anyone given day. 

And then. You'll know how to live. Because you'll have more time.

So. The choice is yours. : ) ","Brand Management, Google Docs, Google Suite, Management Skills, QA Management, Customer Service, Social Media Management, Sales, Marketing, Writing",Vietnam,Hanoi,HN,25,USD,388,310.4,0,1

I have experience to work with Vietnamese and English documents (including both data and figures) up to 50-A4-pages by translating English to Vietnamese and vive versa. Although I'm Vietnamese to my backbone, I have learnt my Master degree completely in English and have just finished the program in Belgium Business Institute- Luxembourg last year.

I can translate English to Vietnamese and vice versa up to 1200 words within 24 hours.

I majored in International Business and graduated from the University of Economics and Law with a good GPA (8.88) in 2020. Currently, I am working as a Product Sales Coordinator at ScanCom International A/S - an Outdoor Furniture Company whose headquarter is based in Denmark. 

2. MY COMPETENCES

a. Data Researching Skills

I volunteered for Energy Globe Team in 2018. I supported them to search sustainable projects online and in journals in the field of alternative energy, waste prevention, environmental awareness raising, and recycling. The data I needed to provide them included: name of organization, contact person (email, gender, phone, salutation), country of project implementation, project title, and link to source). I sent them the data excel file once a week. In 4 weeks, I found out 17 projects with details as above, received certificate and received the invitation to work as a full-time research coordinator for them in 3 months.

b. Academic Research and Writing Skills

My team and I were in Top 15 of the Student Scientific Research Award - Eureka, Southern Region when I was a university student. I was responsible for researching and writing the whole theoretical basis of our study. The purpose of our study was to identify which factors affect the motivation in using online English learning tools, how those factors impact the motivation and what methods can be utilized to strengthen the motivation of students in using online tools to achieve better English results. 

c. Persuation Skills

I volunteered for Ocean Action Hub - UNDP in 2019. I was in charge of convincing organizations working in ocean-related fields to register their commitments in the UN official database. Also, I aided them during their registration process. I sent the invitation emails to 10 organizations and successfully persuaded 4 of them. 2 of them already registered the year before, and 4 of them did not get back to me. I gained the certificate of appreciation and was invited to share my experiences on Ocean Action Hub platform.

d. Organization Skills and Timeline Management Skills

The essence of my current job requires me to sharpen these 2 skills. I have a strict product development timeline and I have to ensure that the new product samples are available for customer meeting overseas or for video call in Viet Nam. Most of the new products have to be modified several times before becoming perfect, so I have to roll out the project timeline, pin the latest date I must have the samples and take flexible solutions to minimize the developing and transportation costs in case the worst cases occur.","Academic Research, Business Analysis, Research, Grant & Market Research, Data Processing",Vietnam,Di An,Binh Duong,20,USD,0,0,0,0
